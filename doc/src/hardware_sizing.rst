Hardware Sizing
===============

Indications on process, memory and disk required are given below for networks with three different sizes.

Packets to Flow
---------------

The table below highlights the requirements for capturing packets and transforming them in flows.

+-------------------+---------------+-----------------------------+-----------------------+--------------------+
|                   | Small Network | Medium Network              | Large Network         | Very Large Network |
+-------------------+---------------+-----------------------------+-----------------------+--------------------+
| Traffic           | < 100 Mbps    | Between 100 Mbps and 1 Gbps | Between 1 and 10 Gbps | Above 10 Gbps      |
+-------------------+---------------+-----------------------------+-----------------------+--------------------+
| Application       | 1 x nProbe    | 2 x nProbes                 | 4-8 x nProbes         | Use nProbe Cento   |
+-------------------+---------------+-----------------------------+-----------------------+--------------------+
| Traffic Capture   | None          | 2 RSS Queues + PF_RING      | 4-8 RSS Queues + ZC   | 8 RSS + PF_RING ZC |
+-------------------+---------------+-----------------------------+-----------------------+--------------------+
| Flow Export Rate  | < 100 FPS     | < 1000 FPS                  | < 3000 FPS            | 3000+ FPS          |
+-------------------+---------------+-----------------------------+-----------------------+--------------------+
| Active Flow Cache | Thousands     | Hundreds of Thousands       | A few Millions        | Tenth of Millions  |
+-------------------+---------------+-----------------------------+-----------------------+--------------------+
| CPU Type          | 2 cores       | 2 cores+                    | 4 cores+              | 8 cores+           |
+-------------------+---------------+-----------------------------+-----------------------+--------------------+
| Memory            | 2 GB          | 2 GB+                       | 4-8 GB+               | 16 GB+             |
+-------------------+---------------+-----------------------------+-----------------------+--------------------+

Note: FPS stands for flows/sec

Flow Collection/Proxy
---------------------

In flow collection nProbe performance changes according to the number of device exporting to it. In case of large
number of flows to be collected, it is advised to load-balance flows across multiple nProbe instances. This by
partitioning probe devices across multiple nprobe instances. In flow collection flows are usually saved on disk or
dumped on a database, thus adding disk speed into the equation. The expected performance figures - per core / per nProbe instance -
range from 50 to 90k FPS when usinf the nProbe cache for merging flows. If you want to bypass the cache (-â€“collector-passthrough)
you can expect to go over over 200k FPS. `Here <https://www.ntop.org/nprobe/introducing-nprobe-9-0-traffic-behaviour-analysis-and-high-speed-flow-collection-even-behind-a-firewall/>`_ can find a detailed report about nProbe performance


Plugins
--------

Enabling plugins increases requirements based on traffic type. Increase +25% system load enablign plugins such as (but not limited to) DNS, VoIP and email.


Disk
----

Unless you decide to store data on disk (eg. using -P) no disk space is really necessary to operate nProbe.


Operating System
----------------

Even though nprobe supports both Linux, MacOS and Windows, we advise to use Linux for best perfomance.


Multiple nProbe per Host Deployment
-----------------------------------

If you have more traffic you can scale up by spawning multiple instances (make sure you
set core affinity to avoiding nProbe to step on each other toes).
